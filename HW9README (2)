This assigment is a PERL script meant to emulate the functionality of the origional assigment in C 

To run this script, you must first give it executable permissions by using: 

chmod +x HW9 

after that, it is run with ./HW9 <filename> <flag> <number of prints> 

It can be run with anything less than 4 arguments, but the file must be in the same directory as the script  


./HW9 - produces a message that no file is specified 

./HW9 <filename> - prints the content of the file once 

./HW9 <filename> <-d> - prints the contents of the file once 

./HW9 <filename> <-d> <integer> - prints the contents of the file <integer> ammount of times 

I have included a file "test.txt" in this submission for use testing the program
